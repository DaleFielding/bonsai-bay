# Testing

I have considered the testing approaches for this project; automated versus manual.

I believe automated testing works well when tests would take a very long time to do manually, or if tests need to be repeated over and over again. 
I believe that manual testing can be better when you only need to run a test a couple of times.

For this project, I have used manual testing throughout development and post development so that I can take a hands-on approach and ensure everything works smoothly.
