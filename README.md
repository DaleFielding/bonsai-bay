## Design
### Strategy 
Taking into account the intended website, I have:

* Conducted research into websites that offer bonsai related services:
  * [Greenwood Bonsai Studio](https://www.bonsai.co.uk/)
  * [Herons Bonsai](https://www.herons.co.uk/)
  * [Bonsai2U](https://bonsai2u.co.uk/)
  * [British Bonsai](https://britishbonsai.co.uk/)<br>
  
  General findings with these sites are:
    * Logo is positioned in the top left. 
    * Most contain a search function.
    * Most have contact details displayed at the top of the page also.
    * The majority tend to white and green as the main colours for the site. In some there is the use of cream and various shades of grey. There is another site that uses red and white as the main colours.
    * All the sites contain the navigation at the top of the page, which generally includes; categories for bonsai trees, links to products or services within the site.
    * All have sections to login/register an account. 
    * All have shopping carts where items can be added to purchase.
    * They contain a banner/main image(s) directly below the navigation, which draw the visitors attention. These contain headers and some contain animations or buttons.
    * All display images of the products through the sites in a grid or various different sizes, these also show the item name and price.
    * When a bonsai tree is clicked this expands to provide more information, such as; species, price,  height, desired location, and general maintenance.
    * Some have additional selling points such as an introduction/reasons to choose them, reviews, testimonials or mention of affiliations with reputable companies.
    * Footers contain links for site navigation, social media, FAQs/help. Also contains contact details.

* Conducted research into digital marketplaces with similar functionality that I would like to achieve within the website:
  * [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.com/)
  * [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/)

  General findings with these sites are:
    * Similar navigation design to the bonsai sites in terms of logo, search function, account register/login.
    * There are also buttons to sell/create a new listing.
    * Also Images of items for sale are displayed as a grid and include; price, item name, location and some have brief descriptions.
    * When an item is clicked this takes you to more information about the item, such as further images or description. It also provides the options to add to saved items, share, or contact the seller.  (messenger, whatsapp or email). There is also a map to display an approximate location.
    * These sites contain ways to filter/refine a search, which is displayed down the left of the page.
    * They have location finding logic and the option to choose other locations.
    * I donâ€™t believe Facebook marketplace has a footer and just seems to continue displaying further items as you scroll down.
    * Gumtree contains a similar footer to that of the bonsai sites, but also contains a link to download their app.

Following on from research, the strategy is to create a website that combines the feel of a bonsai site but with the functionality of a popular digital marketplace. The site should meet all of the expectations from the user stories, site objectives while also considering findings from the research conducted.
